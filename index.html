    <h1>SAVAGE LOVE</h1>

    Jason Derulo, oh!<br>
    Savage love<br>
    (Trixy Cloth baby)<br>
    If I woke up without ya<br>
    I don't know what I would do<br>
    Thought I could be single forever<br>
    'Til I met you<br>
    Usually don't be fallin', be fallin', fallin' fast<br>
    You got a way of keeping me comin' back to back<br>
    I just found out, the only reason that you lovin' me<br>
    Was to get back at your ex-lover but before you leave<br>
    Usually I would never, would never even care<br>
    Baby I know she creepin', I feel it in the air<br>
    Every night and every day<br>
    I try to make you stay<br>
    But your<br>
    Savage love<br>
    Did somebody, did somebody<br>
    Break your heart?<br>
    Lookin' like an angel<br>
    But your savage love<br>
    When you kiss me<br>
    I know you don't give two fucks<br>
    But I still want that<br>
    Your savage love<br>
    Your savage love-love-love<br>
    Your savage love-love-love<br>
    You could use me<br>
    'Cause I still want that (your savage)<br>
    Baby I hope that this ain't karma 'cause I get around<br>
    You wanna run it up, I wanna lock it down<br>
    Usually don't be fallin', be fallin', fallin' fast<br>
    You got a way of making me spend up all my cash<br>
    Every night and every day<br>
    I try to make you stay<br>
    But your<br>
    Savage love<br>
    Did somebody, did somebody<br>
    Break your heart?<br>
    Lookin' like an angel<br>
    But your savage love<br>
    When you kiss me<br>
    I know you don't give two fucks<br>
    But I still want that<br>
    Your savage love<br>
    Your savage love-love-love<br>
    Your savage love-love-love<br>
    You could use me<br>
    'Cause I still want that your savage love<br>
    Your savage love-love-love<br>
    Your savage love-love-love<br>
    You could use me<br>
    Baby<br>
    Savage love (oh girl)<br>
    Did somebody, did somebody<br>
    Break your heart?<br>
    Lookin' like an angel<br>
    But your savage love<br>
    When you kiss me<br>
    I know you don't give two fucks<br>
    But I still want that<br>
    Your savage love (savage love)<br>
    Your savage love-love-love (ooh yeah)<br>
    Your savage love-love-love<br>
    Girl you could use me<br>
    'Cause I still want that your savage love<br>
